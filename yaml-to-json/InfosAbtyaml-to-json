## We could get rid of the entire `yaml-to-json` folder.

The "yaml-to-json" folder don't do anything. It just shows the scripts and the yaml file used to get the json files in "yaml-to-json/themes".


## Origin of the files
* The [scripts](https://github.com/dracula/visual-studio-code/tree/master/scripts) are pasted from the dracula github repo except the `generateAndLint.js` file.
* The [yaml file](https://github.com/dracula/visual-studio-code/tree/master/src) in `src` is also pasted.

* The two [json files](https://github.com/PetitLu117/Modified-Dracula-Soft-Theme/tree/main/yaml-to-json/themes) in `yaml-to-json/themes` have been generated by the `generateAndLint.js` file.
