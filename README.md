# Soft Dracula Theme but my version

Hey, this is a theme that I modified, I didn't create it. I made some changes that I liked at the moment. I'm not a designer so it might not be great but I like it.

## Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's

This theme is derived from the soft version of the official [Dracula Theme for VS Code](https://draculatheme.com/visual-studio-code).

**Enjoy!**
